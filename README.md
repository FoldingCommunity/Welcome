# Welcome

Welcome!
FoldingCommunity is the official developer community of Foldingathome(https://Foldingathome.org).

In addition to Github we've created a Discord Server(https://discord.gg/XrXBkMH) designated to developer chat with channels for each repository to facilitate discussions.

We host weekly meetings on Discord Sundays at 22:00 CET. 

To keep track of the development projects in the different Repositories we use Github Projects
with one Masterboard for the organization and one project board per repository. 

Kindly check them out and get started.

To kickstart our development community we are launching project Unicorn.
